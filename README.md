# Kaixo

A Pow! like service for Linux Machines

## Installing

To install, you'll need Node, then:

```javascript
$ [sudo] npm install --g kaixo
```

## Use

- To redirect `local.dev` requests to port `8082`:

`$ echo "8082" > ~/.kaixo/local.dev`

- To create a static server in current directory:

`$ echo $(pwd) > ~/.kaixo/local.dev`

## Warning

This totally mess up with `/etc/hosts` but it respect your data, so it will only delete
data that is generated by Kaixo, and it will keep a backup in case everything goes
wrong.
